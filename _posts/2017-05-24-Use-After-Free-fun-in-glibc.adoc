#### First Impressions: 

image::/images/blog/uaf/uaf1.png["The Challenge Directory"]

Here we find the usual readable source code, executable binary, and unreadable flag.

Looking at the source code we see that it defines a simple virtual class (Human) and its two subclasses (Man/Woman).

image::/images/blog/uaf/main.png["The uaf/cpp main() function"]

The switch block is what's interesting to us at the moment.
We are prompted with three options:

> [1] Call the *introduce()* method of both the Man and Woman objects.

Notice that both the Man* and Woman* from the *new* keyword are cast to *Human**. Clearly, these objects are in the same class heirarchy, and Human is a common superclass. Further still, notice that we call introduce(), _A function with the same prototype, using two upcasted objects._ Either we are calling the *introduce()* method of the Human class, or there's some as yet unseen polymorphism mechanism that deobfuscates our function call. Running the code, you can see that *Man->introduce()* and *Woman->introduce()* _do not produce the same output for identical calls_, therefore, *they must be virtual functions.*

(This is, of course, extremely obvious because the classes are both defined in this same readable file, but you can still figure out a lot without the class definitions.)



This is a good time to take a look at the *Human* class and its subclasses.

image::/images/blog/uaf/human.png["The Human class and it's subclasses."]
We can immediately see the goal of this challenge: find a way to call *give_shell()* in the *Human* class. 
Notice that the class contains two _virtual functions_, only one of which is overwritten by the subclasses.


Now let's look at the last option in the switch block.

> [3] Delete (and deconstruct) both the Man and Woman objects.

Huh, so we can delete the objects, then use their newly invalidated pointers to call a function.

image::/images/blog/uaf/segfault.png["Segfault by accessing a dangling pointer."]

So, it's clearly possible to _use_ our pointers _after they are free'd_, but what weirdness can we cause with this?
Well, this is where you would start googling "use after free", and eventually you might find link:https://sploitfun.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/understanding-glibc-malloc/[this extremely good article on glibc's malloc() internals], and link:https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/MallocInternals[this very handy reference for glibc malloc()].

#### Analysis

After reading the articles linked above, you might start to see how a Use-After-Free vulnerability can be exploited. Because it is extremely expensive for a process to allocate memory through syscalls like *sbrk()* and *mmap()*, glibc *malloc()* avoids this as much as possible by maintaining sorted "bins" of unallocated memory.

When *malloc()* is called, It searches through its binlists for the first free chunk of adequate size. If one is found, It resizes the chunk (if necessary) and returns a pointer to the start of the chunk's data section.
That means if we *free()* and object, then _allocate something of the same size_, there is a 99% chance that we will get a pointer to *exact same chunk that we just free'd.*

But how can this be exploited?
Well, We know we can call a function from  the *Man* and *Woman* classes after they are free'd and we know that we can potentially write arbitrary data to the chunk their dangling pointers refer to.
The key insight to exploiting this, is abusing C++'s _Vtables_

C++ polymorphism requires some compiler trickery to work properly. For example, if i have an instance of *Man* and i cast it to *Human*, what happens when i call *introduce()*?
We would expect *Man->introduce()* to be invoked, and indeed this is what happens. But how did we know (given a *Human* pointer, which was the "real" function to call?

This is where _Vtables_ come in, and while the specifics vary between compilers (the standard specifies the language, not the implementation) we'll cover the general idea.
Every class instance in a C++ program has a _Vtable_, which is included *as the first member of the object*. This table is an ordered list of function pointers that point to the methods of this particular class in the class heirarchy. If a class inherits a method, then its Vtable entry for that method will be the same pointer as its parent (to prevent repeating an identical method).


Because an object's type may not be known until runtime, the vtables for related classes *must be in the same order*.

image::/images/blog/uaf/call-introduce.png["Disassembly of the switch block"]

Here is a radare2 control flow graph of the *uaf* binary. notice the block at *0x13ab*. We know from analyzing the cmp instructions to get here that this must be the block that calls *Man->introduce()* and *Women->introduce()*.
And, indeed, we can see two *call* instructions, with nearly identical arguments.

Let's go over this segment byte by byte:

> mov rax, qword [local_18h]

This instruction loads a value at address *local_18h* to rax.

> mov rax, qword [rax]

This is telling. We're _dereferencing_ the value we just stored. clearly, *local_18h* must be a pointer to something.

> add rax,8 

now we add an offset of 8 bytes.

> mov rax, qword [rax]
> call rax

And we _dereference the register again and call it!_

This tells us some important information: We take a pointer to a pointer, add an offset, and call it.

Thinking back to the description of Vtables above, We can start to piece together what is happening here.

1. *local_18h* is the start of the Vtable for this object
2. *The second entry* of the vtable (local_18h+0x8) is the method we are calling.
3. looking to the second *call instruction*, we can see that it uses the very next address as its vtable pointer, and *the exact same 0x8 offset*.

Now, thinking back to the offsets used for the Vtable pointer: We know that the Vtables of related classes *must have the same ordering*, so *local_18h+0x8* and *local_20h+0x8* must be different implementations of the same function (in this case, *introduce()*). But if *introduce()* is the second method in both these classes, What is the first? What is *local_18h*?

#### Exploitation

One last time, let's go back to the source code, this time looking at the *Human* class.

image::/images/blog/uaf/human.png["Human class"]

We can see that there is indeed a method defined before *introduce()*, which is *give_shell()*. Now all the pieces snap into place. Since *Man* and *Woman* are derived classes of *Human*, they *inherit the give_shell() function!*
Since this is very first method defined in the class heirarchy, this must be the first method in the vtable, *local_18h* and *local_20h* (remember, inherited methods will point to the same function.)

*All we need to do to call give_shell() instead of introduce(), is subtract 0x8 from the vtable entry for introduce(), and allocate it to the free'd chunk.* Then, when we call *Man->introduce()*, it'll call the method before it in the vtable.

Great! we've solved the logic of the challenge _without even needing to run the program._
To get our final address, we just need to debug the program, and break on the *call* to *introduce()*. Taking the address of this method, subtracting 0x8, and writing it to the front of a 24-Byte chunk with option *2*, should effectively confuse the program into calling *give_shell()* instead of *introduce()*.

The rest is just tying everything together.

#### Execution

Let's log back into pwnable.kr and gather the last bit of information we need, the address of the *Man()* vtable.

We load up the *uaf* binary in radare and debug it.
disassemble *main()* and find the start of the block that calls *introduce()* 

> s sym.main

> pdf

(this can also be done visually with _VV_ instead of _pdf_, but i thought i'd show some other viewing modes.)

image::/images/blog/uaf/breakpoint.png

here we can see that the start of the block is at *0x400FCD*.
We'll set this as our next breakpoint and continue.

> db 0x400fcd

> dc

Now let's step through the code and look at the registers.
We know from our static analysis that the address to *introduce()* will be in *RAX* at the call instruction.

image::/images/blog/uaf/introduce-addr.png["Finally, the address of the introduce method"]

Notice that i have stopped execution at *0x400fd8*, (marked in blue with *RIP*), this is immediately after the offset is added, so *RAX* must now contain the *Vtable entry for introduce()*

We can see from the debug registers that *RAX* is *0x401578*.
This is the *address* of the Vtable entry for *introduce()* (the currently marked instruction, mov rdx, [rax] has not been processed yet.)
We had to add an offset of *0x8* to get here, so to get the first method in the Vtable we should *subtract 0x10*.

Now, all we have to do is write this value _in little endian format_ to a file, pad it to 24 bytes, and allocate it twice in *uaf* after freeing the objects.

And finally, we can read the flag.
