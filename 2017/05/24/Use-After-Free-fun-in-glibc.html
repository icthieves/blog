<p>Here we find the usual readable source code, executable binary, and unreadable flag.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking at the source code we see that it defines a simple virtual class (Human) and its two subclasses (Man/Woman).</p>

<p>The switch block is what&#8217;s interesting to us at the moment.
We are prompted with three options:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[1] Call the <strong>introduce()</strong> method of both the Man and Woman objects.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that both the Man* and Woman* from the <strong>new</strong> keyword are cast to <strong>Human</strong>*. Clearly, this objects are in the same class heirarchy, and Human is a common superclass. Further still, notice that we call introduce(), <em>A function with the same prototype, using two upcasted objects.</em> Either we are calling the <strong>introduce()</strong> method of the Human class, or there&#8217;s some as yet unseen polymorphism mechanism that de-obfuscates our function call. Running the code, you can see that <strong>Man&#8594;introduce()</strong> and <strong>Woman&#8594;introduce()</strong> <em>do not produce the same output for identical calls</em>, therefore, <strong>they must be virtual functions.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(This is, of course, extremely obvious because the classes are both defined in this same readable file, but you can still figure out a lot without the class definitions.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a good time to take a look at the <strong>Human</strong> class and its subclasses.</p>

<div class="content">
<img src="/images/blog/uaf/human.png" alt="The Human class and it's subclasses.">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can immediately see the goal of this challenge: find a way to call <strong>give_shell()</strong> in the <strong>Human</strong> class.
Notice that the class contains two <em>virtual functions</em>, only one of which is overwritten by the subclasses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the last option in the switch block.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[3] Delete (and deconstruct) both the Man and Woman objects.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Huh, so we can delete the objects, then use their newly invalidated pointers to call a function.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/images/blog/uaf/segfault.png" alt="Segfault by accessing a dangling pointer.">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, it&#8217;s clearly possible to <em>use</em> our pointers <em>after they are free&#8217;d</em>, but what weirdness can we cause with this?
Well, this is where you would start googling "use after free", and eventually you might find <a href="https://sploitfun.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/understanding-glibc-malloc/">this extremely good article on glibc&#8217;s malloc() internals</a>, and <a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/MallocInternals">this very handy reference for glibc malloc()</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After reading the articles linked above, you might start to see how a Use-After-Free vulnerability can be exploited. Because it is extremely expensive for a process to allocate memory through syscalls like <strong>sbrk()</strong> and <strong>mmap()</strong>, glibc <strong>malloc()</strong> avoids this as much as possible by maintaining sorted "bins" of unallocated memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When <strong>malloc()</strong> is called, It first uses a best-fit algorithm and searches through it&#8217;s binlists for the first free chunk of adequate size. If one is found, It resizes the chunk (if necessary) and returns a pointer to the start of the chunk&#8217;s data section.
That means if we <strong>free()</strong> and object, then <em>allocate something of the same size</em>, there is a 99% chance that we will get a pointer to <strong>exact same chunk that we just free&#8217;d.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But how can this be exploited?
Well, We know we can call a function from  the <strong>Man</strong> and <strong>Woman</strong> classes after they are free&#8217;d and we know that we can potentially write arbitrary data to the chunk their dangling pointers refer to.
The key insight to exploiting this, is abusing C++'s <em>Vtables</em></p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>C++ polymorphism requires some compiler trickery to work properly. For example, if i have an instance of <strong>Man</strong> and i cast it to <strong>Human</strong>, what happens when i call <strong>introduce()</strong>?
We would expect <strong>Man&#8594;introduce()</strong> to be invoked, and indeed this is what happens. But how did we know (given a <strong>Human</strong> pointer, which was the "real" function to call?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is where <em>Vtables</em> come in, and while the specifics vary between compilers (the standard specifies the language, not the implementation) we&#8217;ll cover the general idea.
Every class instance in a C++ program has a <em>Vtable</em>, which is included <strong>as the first member of the object</strong>. This table is an ordered list of function pointers that point to the methods of this particular class in the class heirarchy. If a class inherits a method, then its Vtable entry for that method will be the same pointer as its parent (to prevent repeating an identical method).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because an object&#8217;s type may not be known until runtime, the vtables for related classes <strong>must be in the same order</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/images/blog/uaf/call-introduce.png" alt="Disassembly of the switch block">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a radare2 control flow graph of the <strong>uaf</strong> binary. notice the block at <strong>0x13ab</strong>. We know from analyzing the cmp instructions to get here that this must be the block that calls <strong>Man&#8594;introduce()</strong> and <strong>Women&#8594;introduce()</strong>.
And, indeed, we can see two <strong>call</strong> instructions, with nearly identical arguments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s go over this segment byte by byte:
&gt; mov rax, qword [local_18h]
This instruction loads a value at address <strong>local_18h</strong> to rax.
&gt; mov rax, qword [rax]
This is telling. We&#8217;re <em>dereferencing</em> the value we just stored. clearly, <strong>local_18h</strong> must be a pointer to something.
&gt; add rax,8
now we add an offset of 8 bytes.
&gt; mov rax, qword [rax]
&gt; call rax
And we <em>dereference the register again and call it!</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tells us some important information: We take a pointer to a pointer, add an offset, and call it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thinking back to the description of Vtables above, We can start to piece together what is happening here.
1. <strong>local_18h</strong> is the start of the Vtable for this object
2. <strong>The second entry</strong> of the vtable (+0x8) is the method we are calling.
3. looking to the second <strong>call instruction</strong>, we can see that it uses a <strong>the very next address</strong> as it&#8217;s vtable pointer, and <strong>the exact same 0x8 offset</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sharp-eyed reader may notice that i said <em>the first member of a class instance is a Vtable pointer</em>, but the second Vtable pointer is immediately after the first. What gives?</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/images/blog/uaf/class-members.png" alt="Class Definitions">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking back at the source, we can indeed see that the <strong>Man</strong> and <strong>Woman</strong> subclasses inherit other members (a string and an int). Where are they, then?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, Nowhere in the program do we edit these values; Once the class is constructed, they are fixed. The compiler likely placed these variables in a different segment, along with the program&#8217;s global variables.
As such, the only actual "member" of these classes are their Vtable pointers, everything else is stored globally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, thinking back to the offsets used for the Vtable pointer: We know that the Vtables of related classes <strong>must have the same ordering</strong>, so <strong>local_18h+0x8</strong> and <strong>local_20h+0x8</strong> must be different implementations of the same function (in this case, <strong>introduce()</strong>). But if <strong>introduce()</strong> is the second method in both these classes, What is the first? What is <strong>local_18h</strong>?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One last time, let&#8217;s go back to the source code, this time looking at the <strong>Human</strong> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can see that there is indeed a method defined before <strong>introduce()</strong>, which is <strong>give_shell()</strong>. Now all the pieces snap into place. Since <strong>Man</strong> and <strong>Woman</strong> are derived classes of <strong>Human</strong>, they <strong>inherit the give_shell() function!</strong>
Since this is very first method defined in the class heirarchy, this must be the first method in the vtable, <strong>local_18h</strong> and <strong>local_20h</strong> (remember, inherited methods will point to the same function.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>All we need to do to call give_shell() instead of introduce(), is subtract 0x8 from the vtable entry for introduce(), and allocate it to the free&#8217;d chunk.</strong> Then, when we call <strong>Man&#8594;introduce()</strong>, it&#8217;ll call the method before it in the vtable (0x8-0x8=0, the first method of the class).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Great! we&#8217;ve solved the logic of the challenge <em>without even needing to run the program.</em>
To get our final address, we just need to debug the program, and break on the <strong>call</strong> to <strong>introduce()</strong>. Taking the address of this method, subtracting 0x8, and writing it to the front of a 24-Byte chunk with option <strong>2</strong>, should effectively confuse the program into calling <strong>give_shell()</strong> instead of <strong>introduce()</strong>.</p>
